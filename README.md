- 👋   Hi, I’m @luzzardik
- 🤓   I've co-founded and funded Le Déclic (@ledeclic on Github, @ledeclic.media everywhere else).
- 🧙🏻‍♂️   I'm Lead Sysadmin and Developer for Le Banquet du Sorcier (@lebanquetdusorcier), a wizardly-infused Minecraft roleplay server based on Harry Potter's universe. This lead me to contribute to many OSS projects like Helios Launcher or Ketting, that I really recommend you go check out !
- 🎙️   In the past, I've maintained all Radio Pulsar in-house and open-data tools and founded Abrege (@nonam-abrege).
